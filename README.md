##What is it?
The SuperWorld NFT Salon is more than just a commerce site. Itâ€™s a place where artists, musicians, animators, gamers and NFT creators of all kinds can showcase and sell their work, gain exposure, and build a devoted following on blockchain. 

For crypto enthusiasts and digital asset collectors, the SuperWorld NFT Salon is a perfect forum to discover creativity, build community, and acquire unique work on one amazing platform.  

##About NFT
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can take the form of almost anything. From individual plots of SuperWorld real estate to compelling works of cryptoart, Augmented Reality (AR) content, along with tokenized sports gifs and Tweets, NFT creators are ushering in a new economy for a new era. 

Today, with the advent of this NFT economy, new and exciting business models allow NFT creators, investors, and collectors a transformative space to engage in and profit from the digital realm. Every interaction in the SuperWorld NFT Salon takes place securely on the Ethereum blockchain, (ERC-721 token) with every token characterized by its digital scarcity and unique location on Ethereum.

##Features

###Upload NFTs
For NFT creators, you can mint your digital content into an NFT on our website. You have the option to mint single tokens or up to several tokens at once (batch minting). These NFTs would then be visible on your profile as well as on the marketplace for collectors to purchase or bid on.

###Sell
Creators/owners of NFTs can list it For Sale at the price they want to be sold on the marketplace. When someone completes the transaction, the buyer will receive the NFT and the ETH they used to purchase it will be transferred to the seller's wallet. 

###Auction
Creators/owners of NFTs can list it on Auction with a starting price and the time they want the Auction to end. Once the time for Auction ends, the owner can end the Auction and the highest bidder will receive the NFT and the ETH they used for the highest bid will be transferred to the seller's wallet. 

###Buy
Collectors can browse the marketplace and purchase NFTs that are listed for sale immediately.

###Place Offers
For items that are not listed for sale and auction, collectors can place an offer to the owner. If the owner is satisfied with the offer, they can approve it and the transaction of transfer of NFT and offer funds will happen.

###Featured NFTs
Creators can pay a small sum of money to promote their NFT creations and those would be featured on the Home Page for a certain period of time.
